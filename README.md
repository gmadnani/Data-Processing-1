# Data-Processing 1

## Objectives
The objectives of this assignment are
* To practice a selection of cleaning and visualisation techniques
* To practice using a widely used Python library for data processing - pandas.
* To gain experience using library functions which are unfamiliar and which require con-
sultation of additional documentation from resources on the Web.

## Background
In this project you will be practice your Python wrangling skills with a publicly available
dataset. The dataset is the food nutrient database from Food Standards Australia and New
Zealand1 in the le food nutrient 2011 13 AHS.csv. It contains a detailed breakdown of 51
nutrient values for a wide range of food items. Each nutrient value is presented on a per
100 gram edible portion basis. It was used to support the 2011-13 Australian Health Survey.
There are two data files provided:
* food nutrient 2011 13 AHS.csv: Nutrient information for about 5.7k foods. Used in all
questions.
* 8i. Australian Health Survey Classication System.csv
